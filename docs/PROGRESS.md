# Progress (sundae)

## Now

- Creator-only v1 implemented (public pages, editor, analytics, leads, settings)
- DB schema + initial migration generated via Drizzle
- UI/brand redesign: new visual system + pixel-cloud grid backdrop across marketing + app + creator pages
- Brand motion: animated halftone dot-matrix gradient layer (subtle sitewide, prominent on landing hero)

## Next

- Decide email provider + delivery for lead magnets / confirmations (currently DB-only)
- Add safe markdown rendering (currently newline paragraphs only)
- Add custom domain routing + verification (needs edge-safe lookup + Vercel domain integration)
- Add Stripe checkout + digital delivery (optional v1.5)
